NOTES:
read reads in an ah file containing data from several stations
     from one event, and all the same orientation of motion
corr reads the Harvard CMT solution for this event
rm   removes records that are known to have problems
cut  out time windows from 300 s before to 900s after the 
     predicted P arrival time from D0 into D1
sort seismograms by distance in D1
deme remove the mean of each seismogram
tt   calculate travel-time curves and store them for display using plot
yaxi, scal, xwin scales the display of seismograms
PLOT data in D1
     plot is the only command that gives interactive graphics.  It only gives 
     interactive graphics when plotting D1.  After entering the
     plot command you must put the cursor in the plot window.  Type h for 
     help, f to flip traces, k to delete (kill) traces, etc.  There is an error
     in the station header for station KIP.  It should be flipped.  Do this by 
     typing f then using the fright mouse button to point the the center of the 
     trace to be flipped.  Type return and the trace should flip. A minus sign
     in the label indicates that the seismogram has been flipped.  Type return 
     again to proceed.

tape applies a taper 
deco deconvolves instrument responses with argument (l) 
     all seismograms are converted to a LP DWWSSN response.
cut 1 cuts the data from D1
copy copies D1 to D2 for safe keeping now that the data are cleaned up.
plot redisplays deconvolved seismograms
yaxi and scal are set for a true record section with true-scale amplitudes
plot 1
yaxi, scal, xwin are set back for evenly spaced seismograms at relative scales
     set to a time scale of 20s/cm after plotting on 8.5/11 inch paper
eval ray_syn corrects amplitudes and polarity for the CMT focal mechanism and
     geometric spreading, but not for reflection/transmission coefficients.
     this routine works for many but not all phases.
plot 1 display should have all P waves with same polarity
eval plot_radiation_bars displays bars to the right of the seismograms 
     ineicating the relative strength of the earthquake mechanism.  Nodal
     rays have small bars.
alig aligns data based on a specified time window by stacking the data and cross-
     correlating each trace with the stack.  It is sometimes a good idea to 
     do this twice because the stack will improve as the data are better aligned.
     Relative travel time residuals are shown in the label after plotting.
plot display aligned, flipped data
fs   plot the observed travel-time residuals, along with the first motions and 
     predictions for the source mechanism on focal spheres.
copy 2 1  copy the deconvolved data back to data 1
cut  out new windows around the predicted time of the phase sPP
eval ray_syn  flip seismograms, scale by source radiation and geometric 
     spreading and use Hilbert transforms to account for 90 deg phase shifts.
plot phase shifted data.
alig align data on peaks
plot aligned data
fs   plot focal spheres of first motions and travel time residuals for sPP
     radiation pattern is for SV radiation amplitude and sign
eval plot_radiation_bars plots bars for predicted SV source radiation amplitude 
     for sPP
